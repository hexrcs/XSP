XSP is a light and fast SQL playground for your browser. It uses the amazing [AlaSQL](https://github.com/agershun/alasql) under the hood and supports all common SQL keywords like `JOIN`, `VIEW` and `GROUP BY`. See [AlaSQL Wiki](https://github.com/agershun/alasql/wiki/SQL%20keywords) for a complete list.

## How to Use

Visit XSP [here](https://xsp.by.xiaoru.li/)!

Just write your queries inside the editor box then click <kbd>Execute</kbd>!

There's also a predefined [Chinook sample database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) for you to play with.

## Why?

I am writing an SQL tutorial and can't find a good online SQL playground. Most "playground" sites have an SQL server running in the background, and some major browsers (FireFox) don't support the deprecated [Web SQL Database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_SQL_Database) standard. So I built this app that works completely on the client-side. :D
